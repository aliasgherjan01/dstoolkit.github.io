Welcome to the weeknotes for the eThekwini (ETK) data strategy (weeknotes are the way we share what we have been doing each sprint and are part of our governance process).

# **This sprint**:

### Data Strategy:

* We further refined the data standards by adding details about what each standard means and why it's important. Here is a screenshot:

* We workshoped and refined the approach that will be used to develop the data strategy. Two important additions for us are:
1: dedicated writing meetings where we can review content
2: using weeknotes to gather feedback

* A digital beta website version of the data strategy and the artefacts has been created. The website will be accessible to select people through password protection. We believe this will allow our team to further drive our thinking that the data strategy is not a document, but rather a living product within the city.

* We have also started drafting the data-driven leadership and data as common resource chapters.

### Council Resolution:
Our team met to brainstorm our GESI goal for Q2 which is to: Create designs to Improve the approach of presenting decisions to the residents.
Pathway 
1. The council app should be able to show the residents what decisions they are making and happening within the council in a clear and understandable way. 
2.  The app should include a mechanism for residents to feed back on those decisions.
3. Then getting a testable point where we can ask residents:
• is this useful in this format?
• what is missing?

There was lots of blue-sky thinking but we had to remember to keep the designs simple as we have the delivery of the Sharepoint form to the Council Secretariat to focus on simultaneously.

We also met with the Council Secretariat to ask a few last questions to inform the information architecture and wireframes. See the basic wireframes created below.

### Strathub:

### Informal Settlements:
Our team created a dashboard with the static data from the Human Settlements Unit (HSU). The visuals sparked lively conversations and helped us define our overarching theme for the use case problem statement "Support the HSU with implementing their data strategy". Thanks to everyone who attended the workshop. 

### Service Delivery:
To meet ETK's 2030 goal of being Africa's most caring and liveable city by 2030, service delivery is a priority. We workshopped with ETK on what features they would like to prioritise in a future service delivery system. The team noted great strides that have been made in the last few years to improve the lives of residents.

# **Next sprint**:

Next sprint our priorities are:
* Further refine the data strategy chapters.
* Organise a community of practice session themed "How to solve priority challenges with data".
* Define what elements of the HSU strategy should be prioritised for the use case.
* Review existing ETK systems to define what exists and what can be further developed to support efficient service delivery.
