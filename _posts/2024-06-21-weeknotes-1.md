Welcome to the weeknotes for the data strategy (weeknotes are the way we share what we have been doing each sprint and are part of our governance process).

## This sprint:

We have setup the working cycle for the data strategy. We will be working in two week ‘sprints’, with prioritisation meetings at the beginning of each sprint. We’ll send out these notes at the end of each sprint.
At the first meeting of the data group, we reviewed the mission statement and vision for the data strategy. Thanks to everyone who attended.
Using the UK government’s 'Government Service Standard' as the starting point, we have created a draft eThekwini data and digital standard. Here is a screenshot of it mid-edit.

We have also started working on a public version of the roadmap:

## Next sprint:

Next sprint our priorities are to create the first draft chapter of the strategy, and do another pass at the standard so we can share a version with you all at the end of next sprint.
