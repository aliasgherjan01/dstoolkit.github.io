By guiding the process of using data for insight driven planning, decision-making and data-driven public services, the data strategy will support the vision of eThekwini Municipality enjoying the reputation of being Africa’s most caring and liveable City by 2030, where all citizens live in harmony. The strategy will support the use of data to promote the core values of Sustainability; an Economically successful city; a Caring city; a Smart city; Poverty reduction and a Democratic & Equal city. 


## Problem statement

The municipality is ineffectively responding towards/satisfying the changing needs of residents and public officials. It uses data in an ad-hoc and reactive manner because of:

1. How it currently organises its data:

    1. data management is not transversal
    2. there is limited understanding of what specific dataset exists
    3. data reuse is ad-hoc, there is a lack of common platforms and processes to support it
    4. there is a lack of confidence, incentives and trust to reuse data
    5. there are a lack of common standards and identifiers for data
    6. data collection is often paper-based and ad-hoc 

2. How it currently operates its digital/data work:

    1. data does not fully meet the needs of decision-makers
    2. data does not fully meet the needs of service delivery teams
    3. the culture of data use is immature and not effectively distributed throughout the organisation
    4. the adoption of modern agile ways of working and iterative delivery is limited
    5. that tools and processes for analysing of data are not optimised
    6. there is a need to build better internal communication around data matters
    7. there is a lack of guidance on how to start and run a data-related project
    8. funding for new data work is …. 
    9. there is a lack of strategic intent in decisions about the adoption of new technology and build vs buy

## Theory of change and outcomes

The aim of this strategy is to help the municipality make decisions about how to use and manage data, and ensure the right capabilities are in place, so it can deliver its policy objectives and meet the needs of residents. It acts as a guide for all levels of leadership, management and operations in the municipal government, as well as external partners, residents, organisations. The strategy is based on the following theory of change:

**By reorganising the data value chain and introducing new ways of working in eThekwini, we can help the municipality meet its aim of becoming Africa’s most caring and liveable city by 2030.**

The success of this strategy can be measured by if the following outcomes have been achieved:

1. Data is managed as a common public resource. This means that the public and internal ecosystem that creates, stores and manages access to data si able to support multiple outcomes.
2. Data is used to empower the residents of the municipality as the primary stakeholders of the municipality and to generally improve the lives of the residents through improved service delivery.
3. Data is used to make rational decisions in planning, budgeting, forecasting and simulation. Strategic and operational decision-makers in the city and external partners have access to the right information and knowledge, in the right format, at the right time, to make the best-informed decisions to ensure the city is resilient, sustainable and liveable.
4. There is a shared value around the collaborative use of data and digital embedded in organizational culture and stakeholders have a clear understanding of their roles related to data governance.
5. The municipality has a framework for responsibly and appropriately adopting new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), in order to support decision-making and protect data privacy and standards.
6. The municipality has appropriate the capabilities to procure, build and operate it's data infrastructure.
7. There is a clear place to find guidance about the use and collection of data based on citywide standards.
8. Municipal departments use data to conduct monitoring and evaluation in order to realise an ever-improving ability to achieve its priorities and deliver quality services and development.
9. Data projects are effectively funded and resourced including human capacity.
10. There is a clear understanding of the municipality’s foundational data and how it is managed.
11. All relevant data can be transformed into relevant business information that can effectively support decision-making and open doors to participatory decision-making.


## Approach

To be effective, this strategy needs to be tested early and delivered incrementally. As such, a set of use-cases that support the municipality's strategic objectives will test the approaches detailed in this strategy while also delivering value for the municipality.
