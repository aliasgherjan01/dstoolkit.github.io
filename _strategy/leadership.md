Data is critical to the operation of a modern government. This importance needs to be reflected in the leadership and governance structures of the city.

As a whole, the city leadership needs to play a part in facilitating an enabling environment that will create a successful and impactful use of data.

## Data Council

The ownership of data strategy must be the office of the Executive Mayor. This should lead to the formation of a City Data Council that is chaired by the Executive Mayor or a designated MMC. The responsibility of this council will be to oversee the implementation of the strategy and monitor key data indicators with regard to performance of the City. 

In addition, this council must have a technical steering committee or be part of the agenda of the EMT to provide technical input to the political council. A Chief Data Officer position must be created that is the administrative custodian of city data. 

## Chief Data Officer

The chief data officer should oversee a transversal data group that is responsible for implementing the data strategy, and is made up of direct resources and positions that are seconded from city departments and agencies. 

In addition, a panel of experts should be constituted to provide external and independent views of the Cityâ€™s performance, based on the data to be made available to them or which they can also collect on their own. The same, or a separate independent body, must be set up to ensure Legal, Compliance and Risk within data governance, and this is where POPI and PAIA representatives can sit to provide oversight.

City Leadership creates the permissions and authority for the data council and data group to act according to the data strategy embedded in the city mission and goals. It also is fed the insights that support better governance and city planning through the operation of the data strategy across the organisation.

The Data Council owns the data strategy and is responsible for its implementation, it consists of representatives from all city departments and agencies, and ensures that the activities of the data group are transformed into implemented and sustainable change within city units. It is the custodian of data governance in the organisation.

The Chief Data Officer sits on the Data Council and leads the data group.

The Data Group consists of a directly resourced team, as well as data stewards, data custodians and data owners from across the organisation, other data experts across the organisation, and those responsible for implementing data-driven objectives such as skills development experts, IT experts, and project managers. The Data Group is the implementation body of the data strategy and engages with users across the organisation through both city-wide initiatives, and data use cases, to bring the outcomes of the data strategy to fruition. 


## Data Governance Working Group

The ability of the city to use data effectively will only be achieved through systematic coordination, and cooperation, of the various data owners, and systems, within the city. Therefore a data governance working group will be set up within the city Data Group, that consists of the data administrators across the organisation as well as data strategy representatives. This group will work to resolve the common issues as described above, create or adopt existing definitions of master data, and the selection of common identifiers for key information resources, and prepare common data definitions, conceptual data models, standards and ontologies. The working group will also aid in the implementation and monitoring of the FAIR model within the data practice of the city.
