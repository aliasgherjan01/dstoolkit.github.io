## Data Analytics Teams

Resourced teams of data analysts, data engineers, ux/ui designers, data scientists and product owners/project management specialists that sit directly within the Chief Data Officer’s function and support data initiatives across the organisation;


The analysis of data is a critical part of the decision making process as it distils the large corpora of information available to a city into singular, meaningful pieces of evidence. These then form the primary building blocks of decisions that will impact the lived experiences of the city teams and residents. Consequently, the analytical processes within a city must be handled with care and systematic diligence to ensure accurate results. Furthermore, the introduction of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) processes to support analytics requires rigorous hypothesis testing to unpack areas of bias and reduced accuracy. Therefore, it is important that the city introduces an analytical handbook that outlines established best practices for the following:
* Data preparation and unit testing guidelines that must be followed before inclusion of data in analytical procedures
* A gallery of appropriate algorithms for the varied sets of problems faced by city teams, as well as methodologies to sanity check results and measure accuracy
* Algorithms used should be transparent and reviewable through a catalogue that understands their foundations, parameters and biases.
* City-standardised approaches for statistical analyses, e.g. when to use mean vs mode
* A standard template for assessing the imbalances, where present, in developed models in terms of both equity and equality 
* Visualisation guidelines for representing data in an inclusive and minimally biassed manner
* Strong version control of datasets, models, and their outputs in analytical processes
* A central repository of developed code assets for cross-city learning and deployment


### Actions

* Conduct an assessment of current city “standard” analytical practices
* Create a transversal analytics team reporting to the Chief Data Officer
* Provision centralised data science tools
* Apply 'right to replicate' principles to the procurement of new analytics tools
* Document analytics best practice in the data manual
* Publish the code for analyses on the central code repository (making them open where possible)
