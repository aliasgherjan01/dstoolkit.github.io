## Data exchange
The key to the success of the data strategy is to facilitate the sharing and use of data within the city and with external stakeholders. The legal basis for sharing data is seen in the constitution: 
The Constitution of South Africa , in which the Bill of Rights 23 (2) says that Section 32 should be read as
_“(1) Every person has the right of access to all information held by the state or any of its organs in any sphere of government in so far as that information is required for the exercise or protection of any of their rights."_
Section 195 sub-section (1) of Chapter 10 of the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa describes the principles under which the government should engage with citizens and provide services. These are:
* A high standard of professional ethics.
* Public administration must be development oriented.
* People’s needs must be responded to and the public must be encouraged to participate in policy making.
* Public administration must be accountable
There are various other pieces of legislation that support the sharing of data and information, including the National Integrated ICT Policy White Paper, as well as others referenced below. Appendix 3 provides a context for open data as a core mechanism of sharing information as a city, understanding that PAIA processes do not allow for the opportunities with regard to innovation and economic development that create multiple benefits for the city as a whole. A city data catalogue, as well as data use cases, will help facilitate the sharing and use of data. These form some of the core activities of the data group.
### Data Catalogue
A city wide data catalogue should be constructed that shows what data exists where in the city, with proper metadata that facilitates its use. This can be an ongoing activity carried out by the data group throughout data strategy implementation. This aligns with the data classification activities of the governance working group, as the classification of datasets provides guidelines for their use in use cases and sharing city data both with internal and external stakeholders.
### Data Hub
A city-wide data platform that facilitates sharing and use of data should be constructed. This can happen alongside the development of a data catalogue, but be the actual place that data is stored and linked to through APIs. This should have all the functionality of a data portal, with the ability to have user level access based on user type. This way, open data and data sharing can be facilitated by the same central hub, and city agencies and departments can link their data to this central hub (ideally via API) while still having their own internal data environments.
### Data Use Cases
A dominant approach being deployed in various cities globally is to use data use cases to build positive momentum for data within the city, and that also provide lessons and insight to refine the data strategy implementation. A use case should start with a current problem that is faced by that department or agency, and construct a use-case around using data (both internal to the department and/or shared data) to solve that problem. The solution should contain data governance, capabilities, architecture and analysis interventions that both solve the problem, and provide an example and a learning experience for the city in terms of implementation of data driven processes. As the body of use cases grows, it further supports the leadership and governance activities that are happening at the strategic level to move the city towards “smart”. One should be careful to not get stuck in "pilotitus", however.


## Data standards

### Actions

* Adopt agile processes and multidisciplinary teams for new data related projects  <strong class="city-tag--light-blue">In progress</strong>
* Make it an expectation of teams that they conduct user research to identify the needs of the users of data
* Require projects to incrementally deliver value, releasing alpha and beta versions to get early to get feedback from users
