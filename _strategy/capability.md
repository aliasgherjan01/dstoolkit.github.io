## Guidance

<!-- In order to create a data-driven organisation, the city must continually be improving its data maturity and capabilities. This involves supporting and developing data skills within the city, as well as assessing the level of digital, data and technology literacy and maturity across the organisation in order to create an informed data capabilities plan. This needs to be co-created with the city’s skills and development function, who, together with the data group need to create an implementation plan for data skills development based on impact priority, and aligned to a use case led approach to data strategy implementation. This skills development plan should be implemented through data strategy use cases, and create generalised learnings and approaches that improve this plan based on real experience and that are fed up to the data group to apply across the organisation.

### Data Maturity
There are a number of data maturity models that have been developed to assist organisations in advancing their data capabilities. However, a criticism of these has been that they actually hinder organisations in data maturity because they create a rigid step based process that has to be fulfilled in order to progress. For example, the Gartner model presents the data maturity path from descriptive to prescriptive analytics as seen below:

[insert figure]

The city should be embracing descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics in its data work, however this should less be seen as a progression, but rather something that each unit, department or agency is deploying all of the above to solve city problems, based on an iterative process. The city should conduct a data maturity assessment, and through that begin to work at all levels of analysis based on problem fit and city capability readiness. The data maturity assessment will guide the data group on how to deploy data-driven use cases to start to work towards having impact from the start of the data strategy implementation. Harvard presents a different approach to city-data maturity:

Within this model, all levels of analytics are being deployed throughout the city as more departments and agencies come “onboard” to the data strategy implementation. Open data is seen as a central tool in building the data-driven city, and public engagement drives the connection between data-driven decision making and positive public outcomes aligned with the Mayoral Priorities and goals for the city. Training throughout the city structures builds a data-driven culture.

### Data Skills

Aligned with the above, the city therefore needs over-arching interventions when it comes to data skills, to gather, hire and train data experts that will form the foundation for the data group and aligned units, and a more general training plan that will see all city employees upskilled in a data practice that keeps the city resident as the primary beneficiary. The typical skills required for a data group can be found below:

_Table 1: Tasks and Typical Duties For Staff in a Government CDO Organisation - Harvard_

The Data Council and Data Group, working together with the unit or department responsible for staff training and development, needs to build, and/or hire, the skills within the data group to reflect these capabilities. 
These groups also need to work together to develop data-based training programmes for the city in general, that start to build towards a data-driven culture in the city. -->
