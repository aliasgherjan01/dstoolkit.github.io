## Communication & Rollout Plan
To develop this draft strategy further and finalise, it is recommended that all key departments and stakeholders are consulted and that consensus is built with those groups to ensure common buy-in for the strategy. See Appendix Two for the basic template.

A data strategy implementation plan that creates dedicated tasks that align with the strategic priorities above needs to be created. A basic example of the implementation plan template can be found in Appendix One.
As mentioned above, in terms of strategy implementation governance, a council or group needs to be established that has involvement and membership from strategy and line departments and agencies within the city, and has the authority to make resourcing and enabling environment decisions that are required in the implementation plan.
### Accountability, Measurement and KPIs
In order to ensure the successful implementation of this strategy, Key Performance Indicators and/or Key Performance Areas of those involved in the implementation of the strategy should be updated to include strategy success factors and strategy implementation milestones.
